  The ST7032 dot-matrix liquid crystal display controller and driver LSI displays alphanumeric,Japanese kana characters and symbols. It can
 be configured to drive a dot_matrix liquid crystal display under the control of a 4-/ 8-bit or serial interface microprocessor.Since all t
 -he functions such as display RAM.character generrator,and liquid crystal driver ,required for driving a dot-matrix liquid crystal display
 are internally provided on one chip, a minimal system can be interfaced with this controller/driver.
  The ST7032 character generator ROM is extended to generate 256 5*8dot character fonts for a total of 256 different character fonts.The l
  -ow power supply (2.7v to 5.5v) of the ST7032 is suitable for any portable battery-driven product requiring low power dissipation.  The ST7032 LCD driver consists of 17 common signal drivers and 80 segment signal drivers.The maximunm display RAM size can be erther 80
   character  in 1-lines display or 40 characters in 2-line NO extra drvers can be cascaded.
